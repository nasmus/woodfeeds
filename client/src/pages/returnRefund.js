      <h5 className="font-semibold">Returns</h5>
      <p>
        You have 30 calendar days to return an item from the date you received
        it. To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused, in the same
        condition that you received it, and in the original packaging. Please
        include a copy of your receipt or proof of purchase with the returned
        item. To initiate a return, please contact our customer service team at
        returns@woodfeeds.com. They will guide you through the return process
        and provide you with the necessary instructions. Please do not send your
        purchase back to the manufacturer. Once your return is received and
        inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received
        your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection
        of your refund. If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit
        will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within
        7-10 business days.
      </p>
      <h5 className="font-semibold">Refunds</h5>
      <p>
        If you haven't received a refund within the specified period, please
        check your bank account again. If the refund is still not reflected,
        contact your credit card company or bank as processing times may vary.
        If you've taken these steps and still have not received your refund,
        please reach out to us at refunds@woodfeeds.com. Exchanges If you need
        to exchange an item for a different one, contact our customer service
        team at exchanges@woodfeeds.com. They will assist you in processing the
        exchange and provide you with the necessary details.

      <h5 className="font-semibold"> Return Shipping</h5>
      <p>
        You will be responsible for paying the shipping costs for returning your
        item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the
        cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund. If you are
        shipping an item over $75, consider using a trackable shipping service
        or purchasing shipping insurance. We donâ€™t guarantee that we will
        receive your returned item.
